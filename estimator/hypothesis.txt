1)by entering variable details like odometer, state, company and all - what is the expected price it may be sold
2)does higher engine power means, higher resale price? - answer comes to "no", but if we add more variables - then it becomes "yes"




Edit to Dataset
1)add another variable called reliability grading 0|1|2 on the basis of brand
2)add another variable called authorized seller grading 0|1 on the basis of seller
3)adjust date time column properly 
4)delete the nan rows
5)delete neagtive age rows
5)check corr between columns
6)what to do with outliers
7)try to get in car maker and model into the hypothesis
8) the car models with more std sellingprice than the car maker it get 1 point, or else 0 points


**Based on hypothesis data, we will create function**



*HYPOTHESIS*
1)The good the reliable the brand is the better/high is the selling price, even better if seller is also rated good
2)As the odometer value increases, the selling price decreases. When the odometer crosses 100000 - can notice drastic difference
3)Even for a good car brand, if it's aged - the selling price will be lower
